## TODO
- Check lighting effect and preprocessing to unify the images

- Add test examples images from regular photos extracted from face detectors 

- Check new classifiers

- Check more feature extraction methods (FPLBP)

- Check more preprocessing and resize images (Frontalization & facial landmark localization)

## Done
- Implement loading Datasets to have the same interface
- Create the training pipeline with svm as base
- Create the single image validation to check a single image test
- Create dataset validation to check on different datasets
- Try LPQ for training and Implement it
- Check the misclasifications and the functions to select randomly
- Visualize the datasets and check their statistics
- Check regular LBP and uniform LBP features for training
- Add preprocessing histogram equalization and resizing
- Change the training and testing datasets (Train with mixture of datasets or change order)
- K fold Validation
- Create video capture that shows label
